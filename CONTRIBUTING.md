# How to contribute to Restaurant-App

This repository is learning resource and everyone is invited to contribute

## General Steps

1. Issues are managed as usual with the regular issues list, just like any other repo.

2. Once an issue is marked as a bug, enhancement, new feature or whatever needs development work, it will be labeled as a **backlog-item** and included as the last item in the Backlog project column.

3. Community members can propose themselves to code an issue.

4. Issues in the **Approved** column can be assigned to a **collaborator** or to a **community member** who would then begin working on the issue and submit a PR as usual.


## Forks and Branches

All contributions must be submitted as a [Pull Request (PR)](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) so you need to [fork this repo](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) on your GitHub account.

The main branches are **`develop`**:

- **`develop`**: Contains the latest code **and it is the branch actively developed**.  
**All PRs must be against `develop` branch to be considered**. 

Restaurant-App is a sample app to **showcase architectural and design patterns** for developing polyglot microservices applications on Node.js, Golang, Rust and Java and Next.js frontend application.

Since this is a learning resource, some design decisions have favored simplicity to convey a pattern, over production-grade robustness.

## Suggestions

We hope this helps us all to work better and avoid some of the problems/frustrations of working in such a large community.
We'd also appreciate any comments or ideas to improve this.
